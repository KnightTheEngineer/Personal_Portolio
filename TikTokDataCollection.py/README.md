# TikTokDataCollection
This code provides a comprehensive solution for tracking TikTok analytics and uploading the data to AWS. Here's what it does:

TikTok API Integration:

Fetches user information including follower counts
Tracks follower growth over time
Collects post-level engagement metrics (views, likes, comments, shares)
Gathers account-level analytics


Data Processing:

Organizes the data into structured formats
Converts API responses to pandas DataFrames
Saves data to CSV files with timestamped filenames


AWS Integration:

Uses boto3 to connect to AWS S3
Uploads all CSV files to a specified S3 bucket
Organizes files in a "tiktok_analytics/" folder



To use this code, you'll need to:

Obtain TikTok API credentials (access token) from the TikTok Developer Portal
Set up your AWS credentials and S3 bucket
Replace the placeholder credentials in the example usage section

# Note that the exact TikTok API endpoints and parameters may need adjustment based on the current version of their API. The code is structured to be easily modified if necessary.
