# Twitch Events Sub 
Web Framework: Replaced Express.js with Flask, a popular Python web framework
Authentication: Replaced Passport.js with Authlib for OAuth authentication with Twitch
Session Management: Used Flask's built-in session management instead of cookie-session
Cryptography: Used Python's hmac and hashlib modules for signature verification instead of Node's crypto
File Operations: Used Python's standard file operations instead of Node's fs module
Route Handling: Translated Express route handlers to Flask route decorators
Event Processing: Maintained the same event processing logic but with Python syntax

The application still:

Handles Twitch EventSub webhook callbacks
Verifies Twitch signatures for security
Manages OAuth authentication with Twitch
Writes event data to JSON files in the specified directories
Provides the same web routes as the original application
  
# Twitch Data Collection

How It Works

Data Collection

Connects to Twitch API with proper authentication
Listens for events (chat messages, subscriptions, raids)
Periodically polls channel stats and viewer counts
Saves everything to CSV files and uploads to AWS S3


Visualization

Real-time dashboard with Dash and Plotly
Historical analysis with interactive charts
Algorithm insights panel with actionable tips


Scheduled Tasks

Regular checks of stream status (every minute)
Subscriber count updates (every 15 minutes)
Daily report generation at midnight
Top clips analysis once per day



Algorithm Optimization Features
The system includes specific features to help with Twitch's algorithm, including:

Chat velocity tracking (a key algorithm factor)
Viewer retention analysis with actionable insights
Engagement ratio optimization (messages/viewer)
Peak engagement time identification for content scheduling
Alerts when metrics suggest algorithm de-prioritization
Recommendations for content scheduling and format

Getting Started
To use this system:

Set up your environment variables (Twitch API keys, AWS credentials)
Ensure you have the required Python packages installed
Run the script with python twitch_analytics.py
Access the dashboard at http://localhost:5000/

The system will work both when the client is streaming (real-time analytics) and when they're offline (historical analysis and planning).

# What Changed
Instead of importing these constants from twitchAPI.types (was having issues connecting to the python library), I've defined them directly in the code:
# Define Auth Scopes as constants instead of importing from twitchAPI.types
class AuthScope:
    CHANNEL_READ_SUBSCRIPTIONS = "channel:read:subscriptions"
    CHANNEL_READ_STREAM_KEY = "channel:read:stream_key"
    MODERATOR_READ_CHATTERS = "moderator:read:chatters"
    CHANNEL_READ_ANALYTICS = "analytics:read:games"
    CHAT_READ = "chat:read"

# Define Chat Events as constants instead of importing from twitchAPI.types
class ChatEvent:
    MESSAGE = "message"
    SUB = "subscription"
    RAID = "raid"

This approach creates local classes with the same constants that were previously imported. The advantage is that these constants now work as direct string replacements for what the Twitch API expects.

How It Works

The code still imports the other necessary components from twitchAPI:
from twitchAPI.twitch import Twitch
from twitchAPI.oauth import UserAuthenticator
from twitchAPI.chat import Chat, EventData, ChatMessage

Then it uses the locally defined AuthScope and ChatEvent classes when:

Setting up authentication scopes
Registering event handlers for chat events


Everything else in the code remains unchanged, as these constants are used in the same way as before.

The code should now run without the import error, while maintaining all the original functionality of tracking subscribers, chat engagements, and other analytics metrics from Twitch.

# I've updated the code to immediately save all data directly to AWS S3 using boto3, without any intermediate upload steps. Here are the key changes:
Direct AWS S3 Storage

Immediate Data Saving:

All events (chat messages, subscriptions, raids, viewer counts) are saved to S3 as soon as they're collected
Uses put_object() method directly to immediately store data in S3
Minimized local file operations - only keeping backup copies if AWS storage fails


Efficient Data Handling:

For large datasets, uses in-memory streaming with io.BytesIO() and io.StringIO()
Saves data in both JSON and CSV formats for maximum compatibility
Organizes by date/hour for easier retrieval and analysis


Real-time Processing:

Each chat message, subscription, raid, and viewer count is immediately sent to S3
Stream start/end events are captured with complete metadata
Daily consolidated files are maintained for analytics tools

Optimized S3 Structure:

s3://your-bucket/broadcaster-name/
   ├── chat_metrics/
   │   ├── daily_20250312.csv
   │   └── 20250312/
   │       ├── metrics_120145.json
   │       ├── messages_120145.csv
   │       └── raw_batch_120145.json
   ├── subscribers/
   ├── viewer_stats/
   ├── stream_metrics/
   ├── reports/
   └── raw_events/
       ├── 20250312/
           ├── 12/
               ├── chat_message_1710249600123_12345.json
               ├── subscription_1710249823456_67890.json
               └── ...

Direct Data Processing:

Data is processed and analyzed directly from S3 for daily reports
Dashboard pulls live data from S3 when historical analysis is requested



Execution Flow

When a chat message is received, it's immediately saved to S3
When a subscription happens, it's saved directly to S3
Viewer count updates are sent to S3 every minute
All data is organized in a date/time hierarchy for efficient access
Daily consolidated files are maintained alongside individual event data

This approach ensures all data is immediately available in AWS without delays, while minimizing local storage needs and providing redundancy in case of connection issues.
